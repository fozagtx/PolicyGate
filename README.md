# HyperFlow

Agent wallet trading desk for paid signals, live source evidence, risk review, and Hyperliquid execution.

HyperFlow is an agent wallet trading app where a Circle Agent Wallet buys paid market intelligence, attaches receipts and live source evidence to each decision, runs model review and risk checks, then executes approved actions on Hyperliquid testnet. If the primary review request fails, the backend uses a configured secondary model helper for the same review contract; the dashboard does not expose a separate provider panel.

It is not a standalone payment demo. The wallet is part of the operating loop: pay for the signal, attach the receipt to the decision, enforce budget/risk policy, then trade or hold.

## Submission Fit

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Circle Agent Wallet | ✓ | `circleAgentWallet.address` plus Circle CLI agent session |
| Wallet action | ✓ | `circle services pay` in [src/circle-agent-wallet.ts](src/circle-agent-wallet.ts) |
| Agent framework | ✓ | Vercel AI SDK `ToolLoopAgent` in [src/nebius.ts](src/nebius.ts) |
| Agent workflow | ✓ | paid signal -> AI SDK Nebius agent review -> risk gate -> Hyperliquid action |
| Budget cap | ✓ | `circleAgentWallet.maxUsdcPerCall` maps to `--max-amount` |
| Receipt / spend ledger | ✓ | SQLite `agent_wallet_spend_ledger` table and dashboard view |
| Crosschain support | ✓ | Circle bridge and CCTP routes for configured testnet flows |
| Frontend | ✓ | Svelte dashboard served by [src/dashboard.ts](src/dashboard.ts) |

## What Runs

| Runtime path | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Circle payment | ✓ | pays the live x402 signal endpoint |
| Spend logging | ✓ | stores seller, chain, amount, tx hash, and raw receipt |
| Tavily source evidence | ✓ | searches current market/news sources for non-hold trade candidates |
| Nebius agent review | ✓ | DeepSeek V4 Pro through Vercel AI SDK; secondary model helper is used only after a primary request failure |
| Hyperliquid execution | ✓ | submits approved actions through the Hyperliquid SDK |
| Dashboard | ✓ | shows wallet state, ledger, decisions, and bridge history |
| Agent Wallet bridge | ✓ | Arc Testnet -> Base Sepolia through Circle CLI |
| CCTP | ✓ | Arc Testnet -> Arbitrum Sepolia route when configured |

## Configuration

Public runtime settings are in [config/hyperflow.config.json](config/hyperflow.config.json):

| Config area | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| `services` | paid signal service URL |
| `arc` | Arc Testnet RPC, chain id, and USDC contract |
| `circleAgentWallet` | wallet address, chain, spend cap, and CLI timeouts |
| `circleBridge` | Arc Testnet -> Base Sepolia Agent Wallet funding route |
| `hyperliquid` | network, symbol, and master address |
| `risk` | confidence, leverage, loss, and position limits |
| `cctp` | Arc Testnet -> Arbitrum Sepolia timing and recipient |
| `nebius` | Nebius Token Factory base URL, DeepSeek V4 Pro model, and review limits |
| secondary review helper | secondary model settings used after primary review request failure |
| `tavily` | source evidence search tuning for non-hold trade candidates |
| `process` | SQLite path, dashboard port, and loop interval |

Secrets are in [.env.example](.env.example). Keep the real `.env` local and uncommitted:

| Secret | Required for |
| --- | --- |
| `HL_API_WALLET_PK` | Hyperliquid API wallet signing |
| `NEBIUS_API_KEY` | live Nebius review |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | live source evidence search |
| `CONSUMER_PK` | direct CCTP route |
| `CCTP_WALLET_PK` | standalone CCTP command |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_PK` | optional seller-side facilitator |
| `TG_BOT_TOKEN`, `TG_CHAT_ID` | optional Telegram alerts |

There is no `CIRCLE_API_KEY` in this flow. Circle Agent Wallet auth is handled by Circle CLI login/session.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run build
```

Authenticate the Circle Agent Wallet:

```bash
npm install -g @circle-fin/cli
circle wallet login <email> --type agent --init
circle wallet login --type agent --request <request-id> --otp <code>
circle wallet create --output json
circle wallet list --chain ARC-TESTNET --type agent --output json
circle wallet balance --address <address> --chain ARC-TESTNET --output json
```

Put the Agent Wallet address and chain in `config/hyperflow.config.json` under `circleAgentWallet`.

For Hyperliquid, create an API wallet in the Hyperliquid testnet UI, authorize it, then put the API wallet private key in `HL_API_WALLET_PK`. The public master account address goes in `config.hyperliquid.masterAddress`.

## Funding Hyperliquid Testnet

`HL_EMPTY` means Hyperliquid reports `account_value_usd=0` for `config.hyperliquid.masterAddress`. It does not mean the env file is empty.

Check the funding state:

```bash
npm run hl:fund -- balances
```

Hyperliquid testnet collateral is credited only after a valid Hyperliquid testnet deposit or drip. The helper intentionally refuses to treat wallet USDC balances as Hyperliquid collateral until Hyperliquid's own API reports `account_value_usd > 0`:

| Balance | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Arc Testnet Circle USDC | source funds for Circle CCTP demos |
| Arbitrum Sepolia Circle USDC | preferred Hyperliquid CCTP deposit source |
| Arbitrum Sepolia Hyperliquid `USDC2` | guarded Bridge2 fallback |
| Arbitrum Sepolia legacy Hyperliquid USDC | older testnet faucet token; not treated as collateral |

Deposit Arbitrum Sepolia Circle USDC through Hyperliquid's CCTP route:

```bash
npm run hl:fund -- deposit 5
```

Then poll the Hyperliquid account:

```bash
npm run hl:fund -- poll
```

Important testnet limitation: Circle's HyperCore CCTP docs state that HyperCore testnet recipients must already exist on HyperCore mainnet; transfers to addresses without mainnet state can fail silently. If `npm run hl:fund -- balances` still shows `hyperliquid_account_value_usd=0.0` after a successful CCTP transaction, use a master wallet that already has mainnet Hyperliquid state or make a small mainnet Hyperliquid deposit from the same address, then retry testnet funding.

The signer must match `config.hyperliquid.masterAddress`; otherwise Hyperliquid credits a different account and the dashboard remains blocked.

## Run

```bash
npm run start
```

The dashboard serves on `http://localhost:<statePort>`, normally `http://localhost:8086`.

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /state`
- `GET /agent-wallet`
- `GET /reality`
- `POST /circle-bridge/trigger?amount_usdc=1.0`

## PM2

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 logs hyperflow
pm2 restart hyperflow
pm2 stop hyperflow
```

## Deploy

Railway is supported through the root [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). Add a Railway Volume at `/data` so SQLite and the Circle CLI agent-wallet session persist across deploys.

See [docs/DEPLOY_RAILWAY.md](docs/DEPLOY_RAILWAY.md) for the deploy checklist.
